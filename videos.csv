"Purdue Expert: ChatGPT and Cybersecurity","Mar 7 2023","Purdue University","https://www.youtube.com/embed/VlsFAOJqy84","In this video, he explains what ChatGPT is and how it will impact cybersecurity. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence-based chatbot developed by OpenAI. This chatbot can be used to generate essays, engage in philosophical conversations and even write software code for users. However, Bagchi says that ChatGPT is still far off from more advanced AI systems that could have the intelligence and independent creativity of a human. ChatGPT is tightly controlled by OpenAI and has programmed the chatbot to refuse “inappropriate requests” from users. This includes requests to generate harmful code for use in cybersecurity attacks. Bagchi points out that some users have found ways to bypass these restrictions and could use the chatbot to create convincing phishing emails in an attempt to steal private information. Bagchi believes that ChatGPT can be used to train cybersecurity systems and human operators better by generating examples of what cyberattacks look like, strengthening the security of our computing systems."
"Purdue Expert: 2023 Tech Trends","Mar 6 2023","Purdue University","https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_YJz6k6fWk","In this video, he predicts what technology stories are likely to trend in 2023. Bagchi says that 5G will reach its full potential as service providers continue to invest in the necessary infrastructure. This will lead to less buffering for streaming content and critical applications for public safety, asset monitoring, and augmented reality will be developed using 5G networks. Metaverse has so far disappointed users with empty virtual worlds and jarring experiences. However, Bagchi believes that there is enough talent and money being put into the project that something substantial will come out of the Metaverse in 2023. Following Twitter’s sale in 2022, Bagchi is cautiously anticipating that the social media company, or one of its competitors, will step up and become a prime player in the internet’s public square. Advancements with genomic sequencing are predicted to have a substantial impact on how diseases such as COVID-19 are fought in 2023. Bagchi also believes that the exchange of technology between countries will continue to become more closed off, ending an era of globalization in tech."
"Dependability and Data Analytics: A Match Made in the Cloud","Jan 12 2023","COMSNETS 2023","https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHPnrIicLt4","We live in a data-driven world as everyone around has been telling us for some time. Everything is generating data, in volumes and at high rates, from the sensors embedded in our physical spaces to the large number of machines in data centers which are being monitored for a wide variety of metrics. The question that we pose is: Can all this data be used for improving the dependability of cloud computing systems?"
