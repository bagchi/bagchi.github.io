<b><i><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>1. Probabilistic reliable communication
protocols</font></font></i></b>
<p><font color="#000000">The use of reliable communication protocols in
middleware layers such as the group communication stack has provided useful
abstractions for building reliable distributed systems. However, such protocols
have been known not to scale well with the number of participants and beyond
local area networks. Therefore, there is interest in designing protocols
that give probabilistic bounds on termination. The analysis of probabilistic
reliable communication protocols has network characteristics as its parameters.
Network connectivity, network delay, and failure rates are examples of
network characteristics. In static networks, such characteristics are either
stable or slow-changing. However, for dynamic network topologies, these
characteristics are changing. An important application area for such dynamic
networks is wireless ad hoc networks, because in many of its applications,
the nodes are mobile. Sensor networks are a particular class of wireless
ad hoc networks in which there are many nodes, each containing application-specific
sensors, a wireless transceiver, and a simple processor. It is as yet not
clearly understood how such changing network characteristics impact the
success or timeliness of the distributed protocols. As the number of systems
built around dynamic networks increases dramatically, it will become critical
to understand the behavior of current protocols in such environments, and
to come up with new protocols to satisfy the new requirements. This project
seeks to characterize the network characteristics, analyze the behavior
of current protocols, and design new protocols for meeting the requirements
of new applications.</font>

<p><b><i><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>2. Self-checking techniques
for reliable distributed systems</font></font></i></b>
<p><font color="#000000">A component in a distributed system - hardware
components, such as network interfaces, or software components, such as
processes - is said to be self-checking if it can shut itself down on detecting
a malfunction. Hence, any output from such a component can be assumed to
be correct, with the coverage of the associated self-checking techniques.
This is considered a useful premise on which to build reliable distributed
systems. This project seeks to validate this premise. Subsequently, it
aims to design self-checking techniques for some typical components in
a distributed system. The study should reveal what kinds of techniques
are required under what kinds of communication patterns and fault patterns.</font>

<p><b><i><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>3. Can we make fault-tolerant
systems intrusion-tolerant too?</font></font></i></b>
<p><font color="#000000">As distributed systems are deployed for running
critical applications, there is an increasing need to make such systems
resilient. Resilience should include resilience to faults as we traditionally
know them, having non-malicious origin, as well as to intrusions or faults
created by malicious human attackers of the system. The ultimate outcome
of both faults and intrusions is to cause a failure of the system or its
performance degradation. However, until now, the two causes of system disruptions
have been looked upon as separate areas of concern, each with its own methodology
and sub-system. This increases the complexity of the overall system and
does not exploit the synergy between the two tasks – providing fault-tolerance
and intrusion-tolerance – and therefore increases the overall cost of achieving
both. In this project, we propose a common approach to handling faults
and intrusions, identify approaches taken originally from the fault tolerance
domain which can be applied to make a system intrusion tolerant and outline
an application area where the approaches can be applied. We also lay out
the ways in which the handling of faults and intrusions must differ and
see if we can derive any lessons from the fault tolerance community.</font>

<p><b><i><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+1>4. Protocols for adaptive
publish-subscribe systems</font></font></i></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Well&shy;adapted to the loosely coupled nature
of distributed interaction in large-scale applications over the Internet,
the publish/subscribe communication paradigm has recently received an increasing
attention. With systems based on that paradigm (called pub-sub systems),
subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events,
and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events fired by publishers.
Many variants of the paradigm have recently been promoted, each variant
being specifically adapted to some given application model (e.g., Java
Event Dispatcher) or network model (e.g., local area networks). This project
seeks to investigate the trade-offs between scalability, anonymity between
publishers and subscribers, reliability and expressive power of the subscriptions
in a pub-sub system. Then, it aims to build protocols on which a flexible
pub-sub system can be structured which can be adapted to different application
contexts. Finally, a demonstration of the system to support an existing
application is planned.</font>
