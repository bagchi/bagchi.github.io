<font color="#000000">Content-based publish-subscribe middleware</font></h2>
<font color="#000000">I have been working at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Center in the Distributed Messaging Systems group since December 2000.
The group works on a project called Gryphon.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is a paradigm for
interconnecting information providers with information subscribers in a
distributed environment. Publish- subscribe middleware is currently being
deployed for information dissemination in many domains including financial,
entertainment and transportation [1,2]. Information providers publish information
in the form of <i>events </i>to the pub/sub system, information consumers
subscribe to particular category of events with the system, and the system
ensures the delivery of the events to all the interested consumers. The
providers and consumers are also called
<i>publishers </i>and <i>subscribers
</i>respectively. Pub/sub systems are a useful tool for application integration
in distributed settings because of the anonymity between the publishers
and the subscribers - the publishers publish events to an information space
without specifying the destinations.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The earliest pub/sub systems were <i>group-based
</i>. In these systems, each event is classified as belonging to one of
a fixed-set of groups. Publishers label each event with the group to which
it belongs. Subscribers subscribe to a group and thereby receive all events
in a particular group. For example, a group-based pub-sub system for stock
trading may define each issue, such as IBM, as a separate group.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">An emerging alternative to group-based systems
is content-based subscription systems. These systems support an event schema
defining the type of information contained in each event. For example,
applications interested in stock trades may use the event schema [issue:
string, price: float, volume: integer]. A content-based subscriber can
specify filtering criteria along multiple dimensions of the event schema,
such as (issue=``IBM'' &amp; price > 100 &amp; volume > 1000). A group-based
system by contrast can only select events by the group name and a subscriber
in such a system would have to do its own filtering for more specific events.
The Gryphon project at IBM Research [3,4] is exploring the content-based
model for pub/sub systems. Gryphon uses a network of <i>brokers </i>that
are responsible for routing messages between publishers and subscribers.
Gryphon addresses the key challenges of efficiency and scalability in content-based
pub/sub system through protocols for efficient matching of subscriptions
against messages and minimizing message flow through the broker network.</font>

<b><font color="#FF0000">1.</font></b> <b><font color="#FF0000">Guaranteed
Delivery</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">I am involved with the guaranteed delivery project
within Gryphon. The objective is to augment the best-effort publish-subscribe
mechanisms with guaranteed exactly-once delivery of messages to subscribers,
even in the presence of network and node failures. Current protocols use
the store-and-forward approach due to the complexity of the problem in
the presence of filtering. Informally, each publisher in the system is
the source of an ordered event stream. Guaranteed delivery ensures that
any subscriber who remains connected to the system sees a <i>gapless</i>filtered
subsequence of this stream, starting from a certain point. A subsequence
is gapless if for any two adjacent events in this subsequence, there is
no event in the original stream that is between these events <i>and </i>matches
the subscriber's filter. The guarantee must be honored in the presence
of broker and link failures. The service runs a distributed protocol involving
all the brokers in the system and uses acks and nacks flowing upstream
from the subscribers to the publishers for maintaining liveness. The work
also proposed a general knowledge model for propagating information in
a pub-sub network - both downstream knowledge from publishers to subscribers,
and upstream curiosity from subscribers to publishers.</font><font color="#000000"></font>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">2. Stateful Subscriptions</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">The second project I am involved with is the stateful
subscription project in the context of the Gryphon system. Stateful pub-sub
is a crucial paradigm shift from message-oriented pub-sub, where state
updates are delivered to subscribers instead of messages. A stateful subscription
is not a request to deliver a selected set of published messages, but instead
is a request to deliver a state derived from these published messages.
Two main differences between this paradigm and the current Gryphon model
are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#000000">The subscription is intrinsically durable --- that
is, the derived state exists (that is, either it is actually stored, or
else it is derivable from information that is actually stored) independently
of whether there is a live connection over which an application is receiving
updates to the state.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#000000">The delivered messages represent states or updates
to the state, and therefore their format will depend on the schema of the
derived state, which is not necessarily the same as the schema of the initial
published messages.</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000">Consider a simple motivating example. A publisher
publishes stock quotes grouped by issue ("IBM", "Microsoft") and the subscriber
wants to obtain the maximum stock price published in that day. The stateful
sub-system defines a language that allows the subscriber to define a view
containing the information which she needs. The initial issues that we
are exploring are:</font>
<ul><font color="#000000">1. <b>A subscription language that allows the
subscriber to specify the subscription.</b>While the language is substantially
like a relational database language like SQL, it needs some enhancements.
The views in our system can vary in their visibility. In other words, while
tuples (or rows) in a traditional relation are visible and final for all
times after the publication, in our system, a tuple can vacillate in its
visibility. A tuple can become invisible, for example, when it is no longer
important to track the row. For instance, if the subscription is tracking
matchable bids for IBM, a buy bid need not be tracked in our system if
there is no sell bid for a price which is equal to or lower than the buy
bid's price. In SQL-like languages, individual columns are primitive types,
while our system imposes a requirement that columns can be relations themselves.
For example, a sell column in a "Matchable Bids" relation may be the relation
with two columns - time of the bid and volume of the bid.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">2. <b>Incremental operators.</b> While traditional
relational databases have the design point that changes to the relations
are not very frequent and the system has to be optimized to handle large
number of queries to these relations, our design point is different. In
our system, the base relations are fast-changing - with every information
published by a publisher. The <i>queries </i>are in fact the subscriptions
which can be looked upon as standing, slowly changing queries to the fast-changing
relations. Therefore, the operators in our language must be designed to
perform incremental work with the changing of the base relations. In other
words, the work done when an event is published should not be proportional
to the size of the entire table (i.e., all published information), but
of a constant order. We are working on designing protocols and data structures
that allow all our language operators to be incremental in nature.</font></ul>
<font color="#000000"></font>
<p><br><b><font color="#000000">Current status: </font></b><font color="#000000">A
prototype implementation of the stateful system was done in summer, 2001.
The prototype was specifically for a stock trading application where the
base relation to which the publishers publish are the bids and the trades.
The subscribers can define various views, such as the matchable IBM bids.
Currently, we are working to generalize the system so that it can be the
various objects and operators can be automatically generated from the subscription.
Parallely, we are finalizing the language and the protocols for the operators.</font><font color="#000000"></font>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">3. Dependency Analysis</font></b>
<p><font color="#333333">I am involved with a project to perform dependency
analysis in distributed systems using fault injection. In large-scale distributed
e-commerce systems, problem isolation, reporting and resolution require
the understanding of the relations between the various hardware and software
resources. The objective is to discover the dependencies in an automated
manner. We are exploring the use of fault injection for this purpose. The
problem is made challenging by the characteristics of the target systems
- meant for e-commerce applications running on heterogeneous platforms
and extremely dynamic. The basic approach is to use fault injection to
perturb the systems, and discover service dependencies on resources by
measuring system output under perturbations.</font><font color="#333333"></font>
