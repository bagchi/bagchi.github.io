	<p class="subtitle">New class</p>
	<p>In Spring 2020, I am offering a new one-credit course "Big data for reliability and security" (ECE 695). This will
		be
		offered online (including for Purdue's Online Masters through edX) and on campus in the second five-week period of
		the
		semester.</p>

	<p class="subtitle">Graduate level class</p>
	<p>Every Fall since Fall 2016, I have been teaching a graduate-level course titled "Fault Tolerant Computer System
		Design"
		(ECE 60872/CS 59001). The course can be taken by any graduate student with some programming (C, C++, or Java; some
		scripting language) and OS experience; it is not meant only for advanced PhD students.</p>
	<p>This class was previously (till Fall 2016) taught as ECE 695/CS 590.</p>


	<p class="subtitle">Service learning class</p>
	<p>I am involved with a service learning program at
		Purdue called <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/EPICS">EPICS</a>. Through this, I have been working with a
		team of
		undergraduate students building innovative software for community non-profit
		organizations – Home with Hope and the Tippecanoe County Probation Department. Our team is
		called <a href="http://epics.ecn.purdue.edu/disc/">“Database
			and Innovative Software for the Community” (DISC)</a>.I was awarded a service learning grant from Purdue
		University
		in 2006-07 for this project.</p>

	<p class="subtitle">List of classes taught</p>

	<p>In previous semesters I have taught:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

				695</a> (earlier ECE 572): Fault Tolerant Computer Systems (Spring 03, Spring 04, Spring 05, Spring 07, Spring
			09, Spring
			11, Fall 12, Fall 13, Fall 14, Fall 15) – a research oriented course on building dependable computer systems
