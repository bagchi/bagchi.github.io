			<h3 class="subtitle is-3">Bio</h3>
			<p>I am a Professor in the School of Electrical
				and
				Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University in West
				Lafayette,
				Indiana. I am the founding Director of a university-wide resilience center CRISP. I received membership in the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) (2020), 
				the
				Alexander von Humboldt Research Award (2018), the Adobe Faculty Award (2017), the AT&amp;T Labs VURI Award
				(2016),
				the Google Faculty Award (2015), and the IBM Faculty Award (2014). I am an ACM Distinguished Scientist (2013). I serve on the
				IEEE
				Computer Society Board of Governors for the 2017-20 term.</p>
			<p>My research interests are in distributed
				systems
				and dependable computing. I am proudest of the 21 PhD students and 50 Masters thesis students who
				have graduated from our research group and are in various stages of building wonderful careers in industry or
				academia. In our group of 12 graduate students, 3 undergraduate students, and 3 Research Scientists, we have
				far
				too
				much fun building and breaking real systems.
				Along the way, we have won or been runner up for 11 best paper awards at IEEE/ACM conferences.</p>

			<p>If you want the gory details, here is the full CV (<a href="vita.pdf">pdf</a>)
