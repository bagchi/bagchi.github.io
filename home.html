			<h3 class="subtitle is-3">Formal Biographical Sketch</h3>
			<p>Saurabh Bagchi is a Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. His research interest is in secure and reliable computing. He leads the <a href="https://www.choruscomputes.xyz/">National Science Foundation center CHORUS</a> (2024-current) on resilient cyber-physical systems and <a href="https://www.a2i2.xyz/">Army's Artificial Intelligence Innovation Institute (A2I2)</a> (2020-current) on assured autonomous operations. He is a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP), a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) (2022) and of the Asia Pacific Artificial Intelligence Association (AAIA) (2025), and recipient of the Humboldt Award (2018). His work has received 13 best paper or runner-up for best paper awards, and two Test-of-Time awards (DSN 2022; Middleware 2025). Saurabh currently serves as the Co-founder and CTO of a cloud computing startup, KeyByte and previously he co-founded (and exited) an IoT company, SensorHound Innovations. He has previously been elected to the IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors for two terms and currently leads its K-12 Juniors and Student Challenge Competition programs.

			<h3 class="subtitle is-3">Our Research Enterprise</h3>
			<p>My research interests are in dependable and secure computing. Increasingly we are adapting algorithms from learning theory and computer vision to the systems context. I am proudest of the 25 PhD students and about 50 Masters students who
				have graduated from our research group and are in various stages of building wonderful careers in industry or
				academia. In our group of 14 graduate researchers, 4 undergraduate researchers, and 3 research staff members, we have far too much fun building and breaking real computing systems, all for the greater good.
				Along the way, we have won or been runner up for 13 best paper awards and won two Test-of-Time awards at IEEE/ACM conferences. </p>

			<p> Here are five highlights where our research has had impact over the years. [ <a href="Research/research_impact.html">WWW</a> ] </p>
			<p> And ten of the most significant papers over the years. [ <a href="Research/Papers/ten_significant_publications.html">WWW</a> ] </p>
			<p>If you want the gory details, here is the full CV (<a href="vita.pdf">pdf</a>)
				(<a href="vita.html">html</a>).
