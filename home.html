			<h3 class="subtitle is-3">Bio</h3>
			<p>I am a Professor in the School of Electrical
				and
				Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University in West
				Lafayette,
				Indiana. I am the founding Director of a university-wide resilience center CRISP. I was elected to membership of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) (2020), 
				and received the
				Alexander von Humboldt Research Award (2018), the Adobe Faculty Award (2021, 2017), the AT&amp;T Labs VURI Award
				(2016),
				the Google Faculty Award (2015), and the IBM Faculty Award (2014). I am an IEEE Distinguished Visitor (2021) and an ACM Distinguished Scientist (2013). I will be serving on the
				IEEE
				Computer Society Board of Governors for the 2022-25 term.</p>
			<p>My research interests are in dependable and secure computing. Increasingly we are adapting algorithms from learning theory and computer vision to the systems context. I am proudest of the 21 PhD students and 50 Masters thesis students who
				have graduated from our research group and are in various stages of building wonderful careers in industry or
				academia. In our group of 16 graduate researchers, 3 undergraduate researchers, and 3 research staff members, we have far too much fun building and breaking real systems.
				Along the way, we have won or been runner up for 11 best paper awards at IEEE/ACM conferences. </p>

<p> Here are five highlights where our research has had impact over the years. [ <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~sbagchi/Research/research_impact.html">WWW</a> ] </p>
