			<h3 class="subtitle is-3">Bio</h3>
			<p>I am a Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University in West
				Lafayette, Indiana. I am the founding Director of a university-wide resilience center CRISP and PI of the Army Research Lab funded A2I2 Institute at Purdue, which involves a network of 9 such institutes across US institutions. 
				I was selected as Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) (2022) and a Member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) (2020), 
				and received the Alexander von Humboldt Research Award (2018), the Adobe Faculty Award (2021, 2017), the AT&amp;T Labs VURI Award
				(2016), the Google Faculty Award (2015), and the IBM Faculty Award (2014). I was elevated to IEEE Computer Society Distinguished Contributor in 2021. I was elected to the IEEE
				Computer Society Board of Governors for the 2022-24 term.</p>
			<p>My research interests are in dependable and secure computing. Increasingly we are adapting algorithms from learning theory and computer vision to the systems context. I am proudest of the 23 PhD students and about 50 Masters thesis students who
				have graduated from our research group and are in various stages of building wonderful careers in industry or
				academia. In our group of 16 graduate researchers, 3 undergraduate researchers, and 3 research staff members, we have far too much fun building and breaking real systems.
				Along the way, we have won or been runner up for 12 best paper awards and won a Test-of-Time award at IEEE/ACM conferences. </p>

<p> Here are five highlights where our research has had impact over the years. [ <a href="Research/research_impact.html">WWW</a> ] </p> 
			<p>If you want the gory details, here is the full CV (<a href="vita.pdf">pdf</a>)
