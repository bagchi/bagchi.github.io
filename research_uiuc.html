<font color="#000000">As a graduate student at the University of Illinois,
I have been working in the area of software fault tolerance since 1997.
We are involved in a project called Chameleon which is a software infrastructure
for providing fault tolerance services to a wide range of applications
- from off-the-shelf applications to applications customized for the Chameleon
environment - in a distributed environment. The infrastructure is adaptive
and can adapt to meet different availability requirements of different
applications, as well changing requirements of the same application. The
software can run on the standard workstations or PCs running off-the-shelf
operating systems like Sun Solaris or Windows NT, and does not require
any specialized hardware. The architecture of Chameleon is such that it
can provide its services in a an network of computing nodes which may be
heterogeneous and may not be intrinsically fault tolerant.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font color="#000000">The project is being sponsored by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory which is an organizational wing of NASA and is based in Caltech,
Pasadena, CA. For my MS thesis, I built the first prototype of the system
and showed a demonstration of its capability to support multiple classes
of applications. For my Ph.D. thesis, I explored the error detection protocols
in Chameleon. Error detection is a key ingredient in building reliable
distributed systems where the errors to be tolerated can be as varied as
hardware errors, system software errors, application errors, errors in
the software infrastructure itself, or malicious security attacks. In the
networked environment, while the issue of application error detection has
been fairly well studied, infrastructure error detection is less well understood.
The currently employed techniques of timeouts or exceptions raised by the
operating system often cannot provide fault containment to a reasonable
level. In existing systems, fail silence of nodes and processes is often
assumed away though field studies and our fault injection studies have
repeatedly shown that in a distributed environment executing on off-the-shelf
hardware components, the fail silence assumption is often violated. Hence,
there is a need to explore more sophisticated detection techniques for
the SIFT infrastructure. As part of my doctoral thesis work, I proposed
a hierarchy for error detection techniques, which can be applied in a distributed
software implemented fault tolerance (SIFT) environment. Within this hierarchy,
novel techniques for making a process self-checking and a node fail-silent
were explored. The levels in the hierarchy were designed to enforce different
fault containment boundaries - a process, a node, or a replication group.
The protocols for escalating the error conditions from one level to another
to optimize the detection scheme and minimize error propagation were clearly
defined. The error detection framework was implemented and demonstrated
on the Chameleon testbed, though the principles are of general applicability
in a message-passing-based distributed system.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
