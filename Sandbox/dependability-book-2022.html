    <h1>Book "System Dependability and Analytics"</h1>
    <img src="dependability-book-2022-cover.jpg" alt="Dependability and Analytics book cover">
        
    <p>The book is ready for general availability, being published by Springer. This is a book that is the culmination of 2+ years of effort by Long, Karthik, Lelio, Arjun, and me. We conceptualized the idea of a book on the emerging topic of system dependability and the impact of data analytics on it. We went about collecting inputs from leaders in the field and wrote the synthesis chapters as well as several key chapters ourselves. This book is meant for a researcher or practitioner in the field of dependability (which incorporates security and reliability) and one who would like to understand the emerging role that data analytics is playing in it. 

      The book is meant as a celebration of my PhD advisor, Prof. Ravi Iyer, on the occasion of his 70th birthday. He taught me and the rest of us authors the value of strong technical work and always being receptive to new ideas. </p>
