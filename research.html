	<h3><em style="color: red; font-size: 16pt;">&quot;Dependability meets Data Analytics, and at Large Scales&quot;</em>
	</h3>
	<p>The above sums up our current research direction. We work on software systems to enable them to perform their
		functionality in the face of natural and malicious failures. We apply and adapt data analytic techniques to work
		with
		the noise of computer systems and at large system scales. Current application domains come from distributed software
		systems, embedded systems, cellular systems, and bioinformatics.<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%'>

	<p><strong>The broad goal of our research is to design practical dependable distributed systems. </strong>This finds
		expression in various domains, which currently include, embedded &ldquo;bare metal&rdquo; systems, networks of
		interdependent assets from multiple ownership domains, cellular and wireless systems, enterprise networks, and
		supercomputing clusters. </p>
