<div class="MsoNormal"; style='color:black'>
  <p>We are looking for a Graduate Research Assistant on a newly  funded project from the <strong>Army Research Lab (ARL)</strong> on secure and energy-efficient  distributed protocols for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The position is  available now. The project has <strong>guaranteed  funding for 3 years</strong> starting June 2020. The interview  process will start now and will conclude once a qualified applicant is  identified. </p>
  <p><strong>Who should apply: </strong>PhD student in ECE or CS in 1st or 2nd year of study. Exceptional Masters (thesis) student in ECE/CS in 1st year will also be considered.</p>
  <p><strong>Characteristics  of applicants: </strong>Interest in distributed protocols, applied crypto,  lightweight data analytics. Good system building skills.<br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>Desired  skills:</strong> Programming in C on embedded devices.<br />
    </p>
  <p><strong>Project  team:</strong> The project is supervised jointly by Profs. Saurabh Bagchi and Aniket  Kate, and involves another graduate student. There is close collaboration with two  other faculty members, one at Purdue and one at Duke. Stellar undergraduate students  will be hired to aid the Graduate RAs. <br />
    </p>
  <p><strong>Citizenship  requirement:</strong> None<br />
    </p>
  <p><strong>Problem  Statement</strong><br />
    Cyber-physical  systems (CPS) are used for sensing the environment, for situational awareness,  and in cases, for actuation. These devices are playing an increasingly  important role in a networked setting for autonomous tasking and mission  planning. Since they are embedded in the physical spaces in hazardous  environments, they operate under malicious attacks and challenging  communication environments. In several scenarios, the network of CPS devices  have to coordinate to aid in a mission and such coordination happens through  message passing among the devices. There is a requirement that such  coordination be achieved even in the face of malicious attacks and degraded communication  (such as, lack of connectivity between sets of devices). We aim to solve this  problem in this project, while ensuring that our distributed protocol is energy  efficient. We propose to achieve this through the use of distributed consensus  protocol that we will design specifically for the wireless-enabled CPS devices  and taking advantage of the network effect of these devices. The protocol may  use Blockchain-based consensus, with appropriate modification for the energy  constrained environment. Our discoveries will be instantiated in a testbed of  embedded devices with a variety of wireless connectivity modules, which will be  subject to induced error conditions and attacks.<br />
