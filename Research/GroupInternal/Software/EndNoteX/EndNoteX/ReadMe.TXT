Try These Great Enhancements:

* Let EndNote manage your PDF files and create links automatically by simply dragging and dropping a PDF file on an EndNote record. 

* Use the new .enlx library format to share self-contained libraries with colleagues.

* View up to eight fields in the reference list display. Use column sorts to locate records quickly.

* Use "Show" and "Hide Empty Fields" to reduce scrolling through reference detail.

* Reference Type lists are now alphabetized for easy selection. 

* Use four new reference types: Grant, Ancient Text, Dictionary, and Encyclopedia. Electronic Source is renamed Web Page.

II. RELEASE NOTES
----------------------------------------------------

Compatibility Issues:

* At the time of this release, Cite While You Write with the available Word 2007 Beta was compatible. Please check www.endote.com for the latest compatibility with the final Word 2007 release.

* EndNote X libraries are not backwards compatible with EndNote 7 or lower. When opening a library from EndNote 5, 6, or 7 EndNote X will convert the library to the current format and leave the original library unchanged. EndNote X libraries consist of both a .enl file and a .DATA folder which must be kept together when sharing libraries.

* EndNote X users who have the language sort set to Korean may lose their database sort settings when opening EndNote X libraries with EndNote 8 or 9. Sort settings will likely default to the first item in the sort list - "System Default" or "English". 


Documentation Notes:


* An online version of the EndNote Manual is provided with this installation as a "PDF" file. To open and read the EndNote Manual PDF file you need Adobe System's Acrobat Reader 4.0 or later on your computer. If you don't already have Acrobat Reader, you may download it without charge from Adobe's site: http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html

* The EndNote Help file is available from the "Help" menu. Many dialogs also include context-sensitive help from a "Help" button or by pressing the F1 key. The Help file is provided in HTML format and requires an Internet connection to open hotlinks.


Technical Notes:

* Personal Communication references in your libraries may need to be edited. 
The "Description" field is now used for "Pages". This change was necessary to align this reference type's fields with the other reference types used in EndNote libraries, and to support the use of Cited Pages for output styles. If this field is now populated, we recommend that you move this data to the new "Description" field. This can be done by searching for Personal Communication in the Reference Type field. With only Personal Communication references showing, use the Change and Move Fields tool, specifically Move Fields, to move data from the "Pages" field to the "Edition" field. The "Edition" field is the Generic reference type field that maps to the Personal Communication reference type's "Description" field.

* Notes regarding computers with installations of Microsoft Word XP: 
- Smart Tags must be enabled to run EndNote's Instant Formatting feature. 
- The latest Microsoft Service Update should be installed on your computer.  To download this service update, go to http://office.microsoft.com/ProductUpdates/default.asp.

III. UPGRADING FROM AN EARLIER VERSION
----------------------------------------------------

While it is not required, it is best to uninstall older versions of EndNote before you install EndNote X.  Before you begin, back up custom styles, filters, connection files and databases. Uninstall your older EndNote by going to "Start > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs."
