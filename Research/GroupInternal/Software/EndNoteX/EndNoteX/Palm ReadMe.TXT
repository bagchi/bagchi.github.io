Documentation:
* Documentation for EndNote for Palm OS is available in the EndNote Manual. An online version of the EndNote Manual is provided with this installation as a "PDF" file. To open and read the EndNote Manual PDF file, you need Adobe System's Acrobat Reader 4.0 or later on your computer. If you don't already have Acrobat Reader, you may download it without charge from Adobe's site:  http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html


Technical Notes:
* After installing EndNote and installing the handheld application, initiate a HotSync(R) between your desktop and Palm device.  This first synchronization will install the EndNote for Palm OS application on your handheld.  Once synchronization is complete, open EndNote and go to Tools>Configure Handheld Synchronization.  Select the EndNote Library you wish to send to your handheld device by locating the file through the browse dialog.  Synchronize your desktop and handheld a second time to load the library on your handheld.
* Install EndNote for Palm OS manually using the Change option for EndNote in the Control Settings'Add/Remove Programs panel. Then select the Modify option followed by the EndNote for Palm OS feature.
* The default synchronization set-up for EndNote for Palm OS is "synchronize files."
* Record size limit is determined by the device and its OS, often 64KB. Truncation will occur when encountering this limit as noted in the log file.
* For Image fields, the name of the image is displayed rather than the image file.
* The Palm OS 'Private' record feature is not supported.
* EndNote Palm OS libraries must reside in main Palm memory.  Version 2.0 does not support expansion cards.
* Only one EndNote library can be synchronized with the EndNote for Palm application at one time.  To change databases, delete the EndNote library on your Palm device first.  Then go back to EndNote desktop Tools, Configure Handheld Sync to select another library.
* If you intend to beam references to another handheld, the EndNote for Palm OS application must be installed on the destination handheld.
* The EndNote for Palm OS application cannot be beamed to another handheld. To install the Palm component, go to Window's Add/Remove Programs setting and select Change for EndNote. Select Modify for the application maintenance option, then select EndNote for Palm OS. Continue with the installation until completed. After installing the Palm component, synchronize the handheld device.
