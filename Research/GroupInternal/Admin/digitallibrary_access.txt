The two databases that we use most for looking up papers are IEEE (called IEEExplore) and ACM (called ACM digital library).

If you are on campus, you can directly access these databases at:
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/
http://www.acm.org/dl

If you are accessing from outside campus, go to the libraries page at:
https://www.lib.purdue.edu/find/databases
and search for these databases (IEEE, ACM).
Then you log in using your Purdue account. It is sometime a pain that you have to log in after a few minutes. So I make my browser remember the login and password I type in there.

For papers that did not appear in either ACM or IEEE, try scholar.google.com. Our library has access to several other databases that you can search through http://www.lib.purdue.edu/ 

Usenix, another relevant organization, has open access policies and you can access papers in its conferences from www.usenix.org
