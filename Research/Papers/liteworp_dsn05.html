1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the block elements. The elements within these blocks have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the block itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the block element and place a second block element within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a block set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For blocks where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the block element's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar blocks could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the blocks around in the HTML source.

      <p class=StyleIndent1in1BookmanChar style='text-indent:0in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Problem Statement:</b> We were looking at the security problem in wireless networks, specifically targeted to multi-hop wireless networks. This was important in the realm of ad hoc and sensor networks and has seen a resurgence of interest with embedded devices that form parts of the cyber physical systems that are supposed to surround us. The open nature of the wireless communication, the fast deployment practices, and the fact that these networks are deployed in areas that are not physically secured, make them vulnerable to a wide range of security attacks against both control and data traffic. These attacks could involve eavesdropping, message tampering, or identity spoofing, that have been addressed by customized cryptographic primitives in the wired domain. Alternately, the attacks may be targeted to the control or the data traffic in wireless networks, such as the blackhole attack and the rushing attack. Since many multihop wireless environments are resourceconstrained (e.g., bandwidth, power, or processing), providing detection and countermeasures to such attacks often turn out to be more challenging than in wired networks. Many of the attacks could be launched without compromising the cryptographic protocols or accessing the keys.

      <p class=StyleIndent1in1BookmanChar style='text-indent:0in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Contribution of Paper:</b> This paper unveiled the concept of behavior-based detection, which is based on observing patterns in the behavior of neighboring nodes and flagging anomalous patterns. The notion of behavior is related to communication activities such as forwarding packets or non-communication activities such as reporting sensed data. A fundamental primitive of behavior-based detection is Local Monitoring, which was also developed in this paper. This primitive has subsequently been used in academia and industry for wireless security protocols. For systems where consensus is important, the node detecting the attack through local monitoring initiates a distributed protocol to disseminate the alarm. Our work led to a patent, cited now in tens of other patents, founding of a startup company from our lab (SensorHound), and a commercial offering of a long-running (2005-15) secure metropolitan-wide wireless network in South Bend, Indiana. </p></section><section>
