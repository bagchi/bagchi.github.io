1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the block elements. The elements within these blocks have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the block itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the block element and place a second block element within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a block set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For blocks where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the block element's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar blocks could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the blocks around in the HTML source.

      <p class=StyleIndent1in1BookmanChar style='text-indent:0in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Problem Statement:</b> Many
        critical parts of our information infrastructure comprise distributed computer
        systems with myriad application level and system level components deployed on
        multiple platforms. The infrastructures are vulnerable to subtle attacks that
        have a multi-step nature, i.e., they gain elevated privileges on some
        front-facing computing service and then &quot;hop&quot; onto internal services
        and ultimately reaching the attack goal, such as, exfiltrating sensitive data.
        This attack model has spurred the development of collaborative intrusion
        detection systems (CIDS). The main advantages of collaboration for intrusion
        detection and prevention are the scalability of solutions as well as robustness
        and availability, e.g. due to the lack of a Single-Point-of-Failure. CIDS are
        also able to compensate lack of central components, e.g. in the case of
        embedded wireless networks where there are no centralized entities to rely on.
        The second main advantage is that it can compensate for the shortcomings of
        individual detectors, both in terms of missed alarms and false alarms.

      <p class=StyleIndent1in1BookmanChar style='text-indent:0in'>At the
        time of this work, Voice over IP (VoIP) systems were gaining in popularity as
        the technology for transmitting voice traffic over IP networks – and now they
        are ubiquitous. As the popularity of VoIP systems increased, they were being
        subjected to different kinds of intrusions some of which are specific to such
        systems and some of which follow a general pattern. VoIP systems posed several
        new challenges to Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designers. First, these
        systems employ multiple protocols for call management (e.g., SIP) and data
        delivery (e.g., RTP). Second, the systems are distributed in nature and employ
        distributed clients, servers and proxies. Third, the attacks to such systems
        span a large class, from denial of service to billing fraud attacks. Finally,
        the systems are heterogeneous and typically under several different
        administrative domains.

      <p class=StyleIndent1in1BookmanChar style='text-indent:0in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Contribution of Paper:</b> SCIDIVE
        proposed two abstractions for VoIP IDS – <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>stateful
          detection</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>cross-protocol
            detection</i>. Stateful detection denotes the functionality of assembling state
        from multiple packets and using the aggregated state in the rule-matching
        engine. Cross protocol detection denotes the functionality of matching rules
        that span multiple protocols, e.g., detecting a pattern in a SIP packet
        followed by one in a succeeding RTP packet followed by one in an RTCP packet.
        The aggregation across protocols can be chained in an arbitrarily long manner
        and spread out in time. This abstraction turned out to be powerful for VoIP
        systems because they involve multiple protocols and several attacks are based
        on sequences that cross protocol boundaries.
