1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the block elements. The elements within these blocks have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the block itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the block element and place a second block element within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a block set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For blocks where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the block element's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar blocks could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the left instead of the right, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all left instead of all right) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the blocks around in the HTML source.

      <p class=StyleIndent1in1BookmanChar style='text-indent:0in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Problem Statement:</b> Wireless reprogramming of embedded wireless networks is an essential requirement for long-lived networks since the software functionality changes over time. The amount of information that needs to be wirelessly transmitted during reprogramming should be minimized since reprogramming time and energy depend chiefly on the amount of radio transmissions. In practice, software running on a node evolves, with incremental changes to functionality, or modification of the parameters that control current functionality. Thus the difference between the currently executing code and the new code is often much smaller than the entire code. This makes incremental reprogramming attractive because only the changes to the code need to be transmitted and the entire code can be reassembled at the node from the existing code and the received changes. The goal of incremental reprogramming is to transfer a small delta (difference between the old and the new software) so that reprogramming time and energy can be minimized. However, incremental programming was considered challenging for the target class of wireless networks because of limited support for dynamic linking or position independent code.  
          <o:p></o:p>
      </p>
      <p class=StyleIndent1in1BookmanChar style='text-indent:0in'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Contribution of Paper:</b> In this paper, we presented a multi-hop incremental reprogramming protocol called Zephyr that transfers the delta between the old and the new software and lets the wireless nodes rebuild the new software using the received delta and the old software. It reduces the delta size by using application-level modifications to mitigate the effects of function shifts. Then it compares the binary images at the byte-level with a novel method to create small delta, that is then sent over the wireless network to all the nodes. For a wide range of software change cases that we experimented with, we find that Zephyr transfers 1.83 to 1987 times less traffic through the network than Deluge, the standard reprogramming protocol for TinyOS, and 1.14 to 49 times less than an existing incremental reprogramming protocol by Jeong and Culler. This was thus the first practically realizable incremental reprogramming protocol for resource-constrained multi-hop wireless networks and remains to this date the most efficient such protocol. We were later awarded a US patent for the innovation described in this paper.    </p></section><section>
