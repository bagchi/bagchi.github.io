  <h3>RADMAP: Runtime Analysis of Emerging Attack 
    and System Health Data for Mission Planning
    and Execution</h3>

<p>The  armed forces routinely use distributed systems and applications running on them  for purposes of mission planning and execution. During these stages, the states  of the various components of the application and the machines that comprise the  distributed system change, due to a variety of reasons -  two primary factors are cyber attacks going on during mission planning and  execution, and changes in the workload running on the computational  infrastructure. We may have to determine quickly if the statically determined mission  plan needs to be changed due to these changes. In the most challenging  scenario, the determination has to be made while the mission is being executed.  Therefore, it is natural to aim for an automated system that ingests  information about attacks and the health of the various system components and  outputs a mission plan and execution strategy that maximizes the likelihood of  mission success. Thus, in this project, we are aiming for enhanced situational  awareness, where the enhanced part comes in due to the following three main  challenges to accomplishing this: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The  data from sensors embedded in the distributed system is incomplete and only  partially accurate. </li>
  <li>The  determination has to be done very quickly, though the infrastructure is  distributed and the amount of data can be quite large (consider for example,  that it is not uncommon for syslog entries and IDS entries to be generated in  an active machine at &gt; 1 MB/s).</li>
  <li>The  processing has to be done on streaming data, rather than data at rest. </li>
</ul>
We are also looking  at fusing operational and intelligence information to dynamically update the  mission plan and to maximize the probability of success of the mission, while  being subjected to the &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo;. As has been defined in the cyber vision of  all the branches of the US Department of Defense [1-3], cyber capabilities are no longer being viewed  as only supporting kinetic capabilities, but also as a primary avenue for  prosecuting war. Therefore, this calls into need a more scientific, adaptive,  and robust mechanism for gathering evidence about the state of health of the  cyber capabilities and tying that to the probability of success of the  battlefield mission.
