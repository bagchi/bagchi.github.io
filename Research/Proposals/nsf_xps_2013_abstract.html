<p>The scale of computing applications has been dramatically        increasing over the past several years. As applications in domains        such as computational genomics, data mining, and machine learning        are let loose on ever-more-complex problems, the scale of the        inputs to these applications has shot up. And as the pursuit of        parallelism has led to increasing core counts for servers, and        increasing numbers of servers and racks for data centers, the        scale of the systems that these applications must run on has also        dramatically risen. A critical problem in developing large scale        applications is detecting and debugging scaling issues, which are        problems with program behavior that emerge only as a program        scales up. Scaling issues show up as correctness bugs or        performance bottlenecks. Unfortunately, detecting bugs that arise        at large scales is difficult. Manually poring through logs or        performance profiling individual application processes is not        practical. Moreover, the developer may not have access to the        inputs and systems necessary to run the application at large        scales. In this research project, we are developing automated        techniques to detect and diagnose correctness and performance bugs        for large-scale programs using program behavior modeling, training        at small scale runs, and extrapolating to large-scale runs.        Specifically, in this project, we are working with computational        genomics applications, namely, Blast, Bowtie, Trinity/Butterfly,        and Margin.  <br />
  <br />
To achieve our objectives, we build statistical models that        incorporate scale. By relating program scale to program behavior,        we can predict how a program behaves at large scales, without ever        seeing correct behavior at that scale, and use those predictions        to detect and diagnose bugs. The project is structured around        three thrusts, each using the computational genomics applications        for context. In the first, we build statistical models of program        behavior that incorporate scale. In the second, we build        statistical techniques for detecting when there is an error and        then drilling down to identify potential root causes in the        software. In the third, we build a testing tool which will allow        us to uncover such scaling issues in an accelerated manner.  In        aggregate, the project combines in innovative ways applications of        static analysis, dynamic instrumentation, modeling, and machine        learning-based data analysis.  <br />
