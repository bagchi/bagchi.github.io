        <h2 class="title">Leadership Experience</h2>

        <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Chair of the Computer Engineering area (2018 - current)</b> <br> The Computer Engineering area is a unit within the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. It is responsible for the curriculum and the administration of the BS in
                Computer Engineering (BSCompE) degree. It has 30 primary faculty members and 12 more affiliate faculty members. <br> In my role as Chair of this area, I am responsible for setting the strategic goals, including faculty growth, and planning
                curricular changes, in collaboration with area faculty. I am also responsible for interacting with current and potential students in Computer Engineering, communicating the excitement and future potential of the area.
            </li>

            <li> <b>Member of Board of Governors of IEEE Computer Society Society (2017-20; 2022-24) </b> <br> I was elected to serve on the Board of Governors --- the Board has 15 members each of whom is elected by worldwide IEEE CS members. IEEE Computer
                Society is the largest professional organization in the field of Computer Science. Within the Board, I lead the Global Student Challenge Competition and hold the portfolio in the Membership and Geographic Activities Board. In this capacity,
                I am responsible for organization of events that engage our student and young professional members. In this role, I am also interfacing with worldwide corporations to have them support our events and to engage as judges.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Faculty Director Purdue ECE Corporate Partnerships Office (2021-current)</b> <br> I am the Faculty Director of this office and oversee a staff of 5 that is responsible for managing our Corporate Partners, corporations that want to engage
                with ECE for student recruiting, research, and education needs. I manage a portfolio of about 30 companies, which include large household name companies in our space as well as several highly innovative startups. I manage the group recruiting
                events as well as specialized recruiting events, enable interactions for research between the Corporate Partners and our faculty, and run the ECE Stories of Success class where leading lights and rising stars from these corporations share
                their professional stories with our students.
            </li>

            <li><b>Director of Center for Resilient Infrastructures, Systems, and Processes (CRISP) (2018-current) and Army Research 
				Lab Assured Autonomy Innovation Institute (A2I2) (2020-current) </b><br> I lead these two research centers/institutes. CRISP is funded by a consortium of companies and involves about 25 affiliated faculty members spanning most departments within the
                College of Engineering and Computer Science. <br> A2I2 is funded by the US Army and involves 7 faculty across Purdue and Princeton working on different aspects of security of distributed autonomous systems. I am responsible for leading the interactions between our
                faculty and the stakeholders; the latter involves both program officers and technical personnel at the funding organizations. I am also responsible for organizing visioning workshops and seminars, typically in collaboration with corporations
                and government. Finally, I am responsible for sustaining the funding for these two units.
