<p><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>Research Interests</font></font>
<p><font color="#000000">My research interests are in the areas of large-scale
distributed systems, reliable and secure systems, system modeling and evaluation,
and computer networks and protocols.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">I am interested in the question of how to build
heterogeneous large-scale distributed systems that are reliable. Since
many business and life critical functions are being performed by distributed
systems, they need to be reliable while meeting their performance goals.
Thus, there is need for smart error detection, diagnosis and recovery protocols.
More importantly, there is need for architectures that can combine fault
tolerance aspects with performance aspects in an adaptive manner, adapting
to different user requirements and different runtime environments. I consider
intrusions to be an increasingly important class of faults and am therefore
looking at the design of intrusion tolerant systems. For a concrete application
context for my work, I am considering dynamic mobile environments, such
as ad-hoc wireless networks.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">I am also interested in the problem of how to
selectively, reliably and scalably disseminate information in large-scale
distributed systems. As information sources explode in number and the amount
of information a person is bombarded with in her daily life becomes unmanageable,
there is a need for autonomic ways of managing the information. This covers
a gamut of functions - information selection based on user profiles, efficient
routing of information through a distributed information space, delivery
mechanisms to the user. I am looking at the current best-effort information
dissemination systems and how they can be augmented with various quality
of service guarantees, such as a gapless stream of information. The concrete
application context I am currently looking at is publish-subscribe systems.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">For details of my research projects, take a look
at the <a href="research.html">home page of my reseach group</a>.</font>
<p>I have research opportunities available in my group for students in
the department looking to do their PhD. Limited opportunities are also
available for exceptional Masters students. Details about the background
required and the level of expectation I have of students wanting to work
with me are <a href="newstudents.html">here</a>. If you are thinking of
applying to the department for admission and want to work me, all the best
to you, but please take a look at the link to see what I have to say about
that.

<p>For Fall 2002, I am teaching a junior level undergraduate course - "Algorithms
and Data Structures" (ECE 368). The class meets Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 9:30 to 10:20 in Wetherill Hall Room 104. For details, take a look
at the <a href="http://shay.ecn.purdue.edu/~ee368/">course web page</a>.
<p>In Spring 2003, I will be teaching a graduate level course on "Fault
Tolerant Computer Systems" (ECE 572). <a href="Classes/ee572.pdf"> Here is the detailed outline </a> for the
course. It will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:30 to 2:45.

<p>In addition, I organize a reading group on "Reliable and Secure System
Design" for graduate students which meets once a week for an hour and a
half. At each meeting a student presents a paper followed by a critique
of the presentation, the paper and a discussion of the research ideas arising
from the paper. <a href="readinggroup.html">Here</a> is an initial list
of papers we plan to cover in the group.
<p><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>Short Bio</font></font>
<p>I joined the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue
University in West Lafayette, Indiana as an Assistant Professor in August
2002. Before that, I did my Ph.D. from the Computer Science department
of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, finishing in November,
2000. I worked with Prof. Ravishankar Iyer at the Coordinated Science Laboratory.
My Ph.D. dissertation was on error detection protocols in distributed systems.
During my Ph.D. I worked on an adaptive fault-tolerant middleware system
called Chameleon. Earlier I had done my MS in June 1998 from the same school
and under the same advisor. My undergraduate alma mater is the Indian Institute
of Technology at Kharagpur where I did Computer Science and Engineering
and graduated in 1996. I worked at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center
in Hawthorne, New York in the Distributed Messaging Systems group on a
project called Gryphon from December, 2000 to July, 2002.
