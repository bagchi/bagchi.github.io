<title>Saurabh Bagchi's Candidature for IEEE Computer Society Vice President</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Position Statement</h1>
<p>The IEEE Computer Society stands at an inflection point, poised not merely to advance technical knowledge, but to help illuminate the societal path forward. We must continue to be stellar technologists; and we must also be the architects of a future where technology serves humanity, not the other way around.</p>

<p><b><i>First</i></b>, while on the Board of Governors, I have worked successfully to make CS the natural <b>locus for industry and academia to come together</b>. Through specialized programs and events, I will foster joint ventures in roadmapping, standards development, prototype creation, and challenge competitions. Such collaborative efforts will yield immediate benefits and will also ensure the long-term vitality of our technical communities. </p>

<p><b><i>Second</i></b>, I will energize IEEE CS to become more of a <b>trusted independent voice in technology matters</b>. For this we will train our members to enhance their impact through their leading technical contributions and through greater cooperation with policymakers and standards-making bodies (e.g., IEEE Standards Association). I will turbo-charge our impact by spearheading efforts that guide technology evolution towards providing the greatest good for the greatest number, rather than just benefiting the elites.</p>

<p><b><i>Third</i></b>, CS must smooth the pathway for <b>students and young professionals to contribute to it</b>. Having led CS Juniors and Student Challenge Competitions as a Board member, I appreciate the role that they have in ensuring that technology is ultimately a force for good. I will streamline our operations and create logical and actionable pathways through which our members around the world, far beyond our boardrooms, can contribute to and then lead important programs. </p>

<p><b><i>Finally</i></b>, I will be the <b>voice for our global tapestry of members</b>, making our programs more personally fulfilling to each member and cost effective. For this, I will emphasize local member-driven events and regularly evaluate our conferences and other programs for their impact.  </p>
