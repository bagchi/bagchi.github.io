        <h1>IEEE Computer Society Election 2025</h1>
        <p>I am a candidate for Vice President of the IEEE Computer Society. I share here my track record in leadership roles, including within IEEE, my rationale for running and my plans to make our computing community even more impactful.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="#who">Who am I?</a></li>
            <li><a href="#leader">My track record as a leader</a></li>

        </ol>

        <h2 id="who">Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science at <b>Purdue University in the US</b>. I am also the <b>Co-Founder and CTO of a cloud computing startup KeyByte</b> (2022-present). My research contributions lie in secure and reliable computing.</p>
        <p>
            Starting from my <b>undergraduate days at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur</b> where I led the IEEE Student Chapter, I have been involved with IEEE in both participatory and leadership roles. I lead the <b>CS Student Challenge Competitions</b> 
            (for undergraduate and graduate students the world over), academia-industry visioning workshops at various CS conferences (laying the roadmap for security in distributed systems, assured autonomy, and cyber-physical systems (CPS) resilience), and am the 
            <b>Co-Chair of the CS Juniors Program</b> (for organizing computing events for K-12 students the world over). Saurabh has led in various organizational roles with the IEEE Technical Community on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance (TCFT), such as organizing 
            the DSN Conference and founding the Rising Stars program in 2020 to recognize outstanding contributions from young researchers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my academic capacity, I lead the <b>National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded center CHORUS</b> (2024-present) on resilient CPS, involving 4 universities and 5 industry partners. I lead the <b>Army's Artificial Intelligence Innovation Institute (A2I2)</b> (2020-present) 
            on assured autonomous operations, a partnership of 3 universities. I am <b>a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET)</b> (2022), <b>an inducted member of IFIP</b> (2020), <b>IEEE CS Golden Core Member</b> (2017) and Distinguished Contributor (2021), 
            and <b>a Humboldt Fellow</b> (2018).
        </p>
        <p>
            I am proudest of the <b>25 PhD and 30 Masters thesis students</b> who have graduated from our research group and who are in various stages of building wonderful careers in industry or academia. I received my <b>MS and PhD degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</b> 
            and my <b>BS degree from IIT Kharagpur, all in Computer Science</b>. I maintain strong connections to my birth land, India, serving as International Visiting Faculty at IIT Kharagpur and IIT Bombay. On a personal level, I have been a 20+ year volunteer with Asha for Education, 
            an organization that has branches at all major US universities, and that has been providing basic education to underprivileged children in India since 1991. I love my treks on paths all across the globe, trodden and untrodden, with his family.
        </p>

        <h2 id="leader">My track record as a leader</h2>
        <p>
            I have been fortunate to have led several teams and efforts that have led to tangible positive impacts in our world. I use this saying as my touchstone: "There are no losers on a winning team, and no winners on a losing team." (Fred Brooks Jr.)

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Chair, Computer Society Student Challenge Competition (2021-current):</b>
                The challenge competitions provide a platform for students to create innovative solutions to real-world problems based on real-world datasets, provided by academic and industry teams. These competitions alternately focus on the global student community and the 
                North America-based student community. For the last Global Student Competition, 500 students registered and for the last North America Competition (2024), 43 teams registered. Each was financially sponsored by IEEE CS and private industry, organized with two other 
                Board member colleagues (Prof. Deborah Silver and Prof. Joaquim Jorge), and the final happened at an IEEE CS conference.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Board of Governor Member (2017-20, 2022-24):</b>
                I took on various participatory and leadership roles during my stints on the board. These were largely focused on two overarching goals â€” energizing students and young professionals, and creating synergies between academic and industry professionals. Specific roles 
                were leading student activities within the Geographical Activities Committee (GAC), IEEE CS representative to IEEE Biometrics Council, Charter Member of CS Distinguished Contributor Recognition Program, and member of Ad-Hoc Committee on expansion of CS activities. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Distinguished Visitor, IEEE Computer Society (2021-24):</b>
                I was selected as a Distinguished Visitor and gave 6 talks (including two keynote talks) at various campuses (IISc Bangalore, University of Lisbon, University of Glasgow, etc.) and CS conferences (keynotes at ISSRE, InC4). Topics included "Turning Padawans to 
                Jedi Knights: Best practices for training our computing students", "How to have a Terrific or a Terrible Life During Your First Three Years as Faculty", and "Dependability and Data Analytics: A Match Made in the Cloud".
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Co-Chair, IEEE CS Juniors Program (2025); Member (2024):</b>
                This is a global program, started in 2024, meant to inspire K-12 students to explore and excel in computing activities. The goal of the program is to spark curiosity in computer science and build lasting relationships with students, educators, and communities. 
                As Co-Chair, my responsibilities include defining the rubric for selection of projects, coordinating evaluation of the proposals for events, and helping the organizers with the successful execution of the events.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Steering Committee and Organizing Committee of TCFTC and DSN Conference (7 times in the last 10 years):</b>
                I have been a core member of the IEEE CS Technical Community on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance (TCFTC). I have been in the Organizing Committee of the primary conference of the TC, Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN), 7 times in the last 10 years, 
                including in prominent roles like Founder of the Rising Star Award (2020), Workshop Chair (2021, 2025), Steering Committee (2018-19), and PC Chair (2011).
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="plans">My plans for our computing community</h2>
        <p>
            I have lofty goals to make Computer Society an even better representative for our technical community. My goals are ambitious but grounded in tangible plans to accomplish them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>First,</i> I will energize our organization to become even more of a trusted independent voice in technology matters.</b>
            This means we will train our members to enhance their impact through their leading technical contributions and through greater cooperation with standards making bodies (including IEEE) and policy makers. I am bullish that in this time of great technological disruption, 
            doomsayers about the future of our profession are wrong. Researchers and practitioners like us will grow and flourish and professional societies like ours have a pivotal role to play in harnessing our creativity and passion. I will put in place mentoring and 
            training programs to enable us to reach this destination.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of this, I will elevate the impact of CS by leading <b>roadmapping efforts in technologies</b> that are being rapidly developed and commercialized. Thus, I will guide these technologies toward serving the greatest good of the greatest number.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Second,</i></b> while I have been on the Board of Governors, I have worked fruitfully to <b>make CS the natural locus for industry and academia to collaborate</b>. I will put in place programs and events where they can come together to undertake joint activities, such as, roadmapping efforts, standards and prototype building, and challenge competitions. These joint activities will further their short-term goals as well as contribute to the long-term flowering of our technical communities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Third,</i> I will make CS more agile in vetting technologies and promoting the most promising ones that offer solutions to our pressing societal problems.</b> 
            Through this, I will underline my firm belief that technology is a force for good, and CS needs to be a leader in this movement. I will achieve this through further streamlining of our operations and making sure we are constantly listening to voices outside our board rooms and absorbing and acting upon the cogent pieces of feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Finally,</i> I will be the voice for the thousands of our members</b> 
            from all across the globe to whom IEEE is but a distant presence. I will achieve this through local member-driven events and at a global level, highlighting that most of technology is human centered. I will demonstrate through collective leadership how we can enhance the human aspects of our technology, both as designers and implementers and as users.
